**Introduction**
Credit card fraud is a significant issue in the financial industry, leading to substantial financial losses for both credit card companies and cardholders. Machine learning models offer a promising solution for detecting fraudulent transactions, as they can learn patterns from historical data and identify anomalies.
This project focuses on building a machine-learning model capable of accurately identifying fraudulent transactions while minimizing false positives.

**Dataset**
The dataset used for this project is sourced from https://www.kaggle.com.
It consists of a labeled set of credit card transactions, with each transaction marked as either fraudulent or non-fraudulent. Link to the dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud

**Dependencies**
Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:
-> Python (>=3.6)
-> NumPy
-> Pandas
-> Scikit-learn
-> Matplotlib
-> Seaborn
You can install the dependencies using: 
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    
**Installation**
Clone the repository to your local machine:
    git clone https://github.com/Vamshitha211/Fraud-Detection-using-Machine-Learning.git cd Fraud-Detection-using-Machine-Learning
    
**Usage**
To use the fraud detection model, follow these steps:
1. Install the dependencies.
2. Run the predict.py script with the credit card transaction data you want to analyze:
      python predict.py --input_path path/to/your/transaction_data.csv --output_path path/to/save/predictions.csv
This script will generate a CSV file with predictions for each transaction.

**Model Training**
If you want to retrain the model on a new dataset or with different parameters, follow these steps:
1. Prepare your dataset in CSV format with labeled transactions.
2. Update the config.yaml file with the path to your training dataset and other parameters.
3. Run the train.py script:
      python train.py
This script will train the model and save it to the specified output path in the configuration.

**Evaluation**
Evaluate the model's performance using the evaluate.py script:
     python evaluate.py --input_path path/to/your/predictions.csv
This script will generate metrics and visualizations to assess the model's effectiveness.
